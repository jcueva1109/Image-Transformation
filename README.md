# Image Transformation
## Author: Jesus Cueva

This project was carried out in C++. It was done for a class project I was taking at the time. 
It objective is to take as input an image an apply a filter (matrix of change) to the input image and as a result
the ouput will be the image with the filter applied. 
* Gaussian Filter
* Gray Scale
* Displacement

These are the three different filters that the project can apply to any kind of image. Also this project applies concurrency methodology in which it includes
pthreads to show how threads execute in a heavy task.
